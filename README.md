Tabable Required Fields
================================
A very simple jQuery plugin that prevents web forms from being submitted on 'Enter' keypress and replaces this default behavior with a more convenient one. It focuses on the next required field in the form. If no fields are required the plugin will take you through each input one at a time (just like the 'Tab' keypress behavior in this case) 

## Possible Enhancements:
	1. Integration with the [Flying Focus Effect Plugin](https://github.com/NV/flying-focus)
	
## Online Demo:

## Usage Example:

### HTML

Currenty with the simple implementation of the plugin you are only required to include the Plugin file in the header of your page
```HTML

//Implement the tabable required fields plugin
<script src="js/jQuery.tabable-required-focus.js"></script>

```
