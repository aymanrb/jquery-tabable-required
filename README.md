Tabable Required Fields
================================
A very simple jQuery plugin that prevents web forms from being submitted on 'Enter' keypress and replaces this default behavior with a more convenient one. It focuses on the next required field in the form. If no fields are required the plugin will take you through each input one at a time (just like the 'Tab' keypress behavior in this case)
